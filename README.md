# 👋 Hi, I'm Lee Jian Hui

🚀 I'm a full-stack developer with 2+ years of experience building things that *actually get used* — from internal AI tools and automation platforms to production-grade chatbots and analytics pipelines at Dell Technologies.

🧠 Passionate about working on innovative ideas, early-stage projects, open-source tools, and startups. Looking to join hands-on efforts that blend AI with real-world utility.

💬 I’m active in developer communities (like contributing to PrivateGPT) and was once invited to speak at a national Google Apps Script hackathon with 1,000+ participants.

- 🤖 A Rasa chatbot platform serving 1k+ users daily with dynamic API-driven responses and an end-to-end CI test suite  
- 📊 Dashboards and ETL pipelines to track LLM usage trends across internal teams, backed by PostgreSQL and Redis  
- 🧠 A side project LLM agent that turns natural language into SQL queries (useful for analytics & banking data)
